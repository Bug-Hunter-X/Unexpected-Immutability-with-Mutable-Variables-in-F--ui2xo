# F# Mutable Variable Bug

This example demonstrates a common pitfall in F# involving mutable variables.  While F# supports mutability, the way it interacts with expressions can be counter-intuitive for those coming from imperative languages.

The `bug.fs` file contains code that showcases this behavior.  The `bugSolution.fs` file provides a corrected version.

This repository is for educational purposes to highlight this specific quirk of F#'s type system and help developers avoid this issue.
